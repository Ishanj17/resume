The coding question was based on graphs, where I had to work with a grid of 1’s and 0’s, with 1 representing bomb cells. Given a source cell, I had to detonate all connected cells using an approach similar to the Flood Fill algorithm and return the total count of detonated cells


 In the debugging section, I was given code with multiple banking operation functions containing bugs. I analyzed and fixed most of them, and with the help of hints from the interviewer, I resolved the remaining issues as well. I successfully cleared this round.


In Round 2 (2 hours), the format was similar. The coding part again involved a graph problem where I had to apply either DFS or BFS to solve a grid-based task, similar to the Flood Fill problem. The debugging task involved fixing bugs in the Game of Life simulation. Although I managed to fix a few issues, I couldn’t resolve all bugs within the given time, and the problem remained partially solved.


They provided me some codes to debug.It was an banking system debug code.Also they provided me some leet code questions related to minesweeper game.

Debugging: A banking application was provided, and I had to debug four issues. With some hints from the interviewer, I was able to solve all four. 

Coding: A Minesweeper-like problem was given, which could be solved using the flood-fill algorithm (either via DFS or BFS). I implemented the solution successfully and cleared the round.


 Round 2 (March 10 & March 13, 2025) - Debugging (1 hour) + Coding (1 hour) This round was conducted in two parts on different days. Debugging Round (March 10, 2025): The problem was a Game of Life simulation. Despite my best efforts, I could only fix the logical mistakes but struggled with other parts. Unfortunately, the interviewer didn't provide much guidance. Coding Round (March 13, 2025): The task was to print the top 10 leaderboard of a game, where the required data had to be retrieved from an API provided by the interviewer.

Debug Conway's Game of Life


Debugging questions was to fix the code for a dummy bank system made up of bank, account, person class. Code was very verbose I and took time to fully understand it. Coding question was similar to minesweeper. Can be solved by Flood fill algorithm or BFS or DFS.


Given a graph that's full of mines like in Minesweeper, find how far a given cell is from the nearest mine. - There's another one similar to the question above but with pantries full of snacks that you have to reach, and with walls in the way that you can't traverse over. - DFS and BFS are good to know well. Debugging: - The main debugging question is about four different functions related to banking software. For example, one function is about John transferring money to Bill, but it is failing test cases and you have to figure out why. The reasons are something like you have to add a check for how much money a person has in the bank, or you have to make realize that the code is in slightly the wrong order; small, trivial, but tricky mistakes in the code. System Design: - They basically just ask you about how you would design an airport system. So think about how would you make the employee class, the passenger class, the airport class, the flight class, etc. And then how they work together.

I was asked the "Number of Laser Beams in a Bank" problem, where I had to figure out how many laser beams could be formed between security devices represented in a 2D grid.

My approach was to first understand the rules clearly, each floor is a row, and each '1' is a device. I counted the number of devices on each non-empty floor and ignored completely empty rows.

Then, I noticed that the number of beams formed between any two consecutive non-empty floors is just the product of the device counts on those floors. So, I simply multiplied the counts of each consecutive pair of non-empty rows and added them up to get the answer. I explained my logic and reasoning step-by-step, keeping the solution simple and efficient.

This round was quite practical, more like a real engineering task. I received several API endpoints and was asked to fetch, process, and aggregate data to build a leaderboard of the top 10 players, based on specific criteria provided.

The round had two parts, the first part (core leaderboard task) was mandatory, while the second part included three bonus sub-problems, such as implementing different sorting options or advanced filters

 how I collaborate in teams, my approach to tough problems, and scenarios related to conflict resolution and working in ambiguous situations.



*. Given a bank application, how would you debug a function to find basic logic issues or premature returns?
Ans. Identify and fix bugs in a bank application function to ensure correct logic and flow.
Check for early returns that may skip necessary logic, e.g., returning if account balance is zero without processing withdrawal.
Ensure all edge cases are handled, such as negative amounts or invalid account numbers.
Verify that all conditions are correctly evaluated, e.g., using '==' instead of '=' in comparisons.
Look for off-by-one errors in loops or array indexing that could lead to incorrect data processing.
Confirm that resources are properly released, such as closing database connections after use.*

Coding - Graph Question: In the coding part of the interview, I was presented with a challenging question related to graphs. The task was to work with a grid consisting of 1's and 0's, where each 1 represented a bomb cell. Additionally, I was given the coordinates of a source cell (source row and source column). My objective was to detonate each cell connected to the given source cell and then return the number of cells that were successfully detonated.

anking Operations Function: In the debugging part of the interview, I was given a pre-written code that contained various functions related to banking operations. However, each function had bugs that needed to be identified and corrected in order to pass all the test cases.
With careful examination and analysis of the code, I managed to identify and resolve some of the bugs present in the functions. The interviewer was supportive and provided hints that proved to be helpful in resolving the remaining issues. Through collaboration and my problem-solving skills, I was able to fix all the bugs and ensure that each function worked as intende

Round 2
For the coding part, I was presented with another problem related to graphs. This time, the task involved practicing Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The problem was similar to the one in the previous round, where I needed to work with a grid and apply DFS or BFS to achieve a specific objective. Like https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/flood-fill-algorithm/
Debugging - Game of Life: In the debugging part of the interview, I was given a pre-written code for the popular "Game of Life" simulation. However, the code contained bugs that needed to be identified and fixed in order to pass all the test cases.


Coding (Graph-based Problem):
I was given a problem based on a 2D grid consisting of 1s and 0s, where each 1 represented a bomb cell. Along with the grid, I was given the coordinates of a source cell. The objective was to simulate the detonation of all connected bomb cells starting from the source and return the total number of cells detonated. The problem resembled the Flood Fill Algorithm.
Reference: Flood Fill Algorithm - GeeksforGeeks

2. Debugging (Banking Operations):
The debugging portion involved a set of pre-written functions handling banking operations. Each function contained logical or syntactical errors that needed to be identified and corrected to pass the test scenarios. I managed to fix all the bugs and ensured that the functions behaved as expected.

I cleared this round successfully.

Round 3 — Virtual Face-to-Face Interview (1 hour, Google Meet)
This round focused entirely on debugging, particularly involving API integration and data handling.

I was provided with API endpoints containing data for top player performances across multiple game types (around 5 in total). Each player could participate in multiple games and have multiple top scores. The task was to extract and process the data to identify the top 10 performers across all games.

Additionally, I was required to handle edge cases — such as when a player appeared multiple times due to having top scores in the same or different games. The challenge involved careful data aggregation and proper handling of duplicates or overlapping entries.

Although I managed to resolve several issues and implement parts of the required logic, I could not fully complete the problem during the allotted time.
